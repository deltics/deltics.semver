# Introduction 
SemVer provides an implementation of Semantic Version.

# Getting Started - Duget Package
To use this library simply add `deltics.semver` to your project .duget file and run `duget update` to obtain the latest version available in any of your feeds (duget.org is recommended, or will be once it's up and running).


# Build and Test
The build pipeline for this package compiles a set of tests for every version of Delphi from 7 thru 10.3.  These tests use the [https://github.com/deltics/deltics.smoketest](Smoketest 2.x) test framework.


# Roadmap

TBD
